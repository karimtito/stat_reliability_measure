## Experimental design: comparison of Statistical Reliability methods for Neural Networks

### Goal 

The goal is to benchmark the different methods of Statistical Reliability Engineering in the context of Neural Networks classifiers. The methods included to date include:
* Vanilla Monte Carlo (MC)
* Multiple Importance Splitting (MLS)
* Hamiltonian-Sequential Monte Carlo (H_SMC)
* Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm within Sequential Monte Carlo (MALA_SMC)
* First Order Reliability Method (FORM)
* Importance Sampling methods (IS)
