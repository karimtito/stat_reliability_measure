# Experimental design: comparison of Statistical Reliability methods for Neural Networks

## 1. Goal 

The goal is to benchmark the different methods of Statistical Reliability Engineering in the context of Neural Networks classifiers. The methods to compare include:

- [ ] Vanilla Monte Carlo (MC)
- [ ] Multiple Importance Splitting (MLS)
