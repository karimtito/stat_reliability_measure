# Experimental design: comparison of Statistical Reliability methods for Neural Networks

## 1. Goal 

The goal is to benchmark the different methods of Statistical Reliability Engineering in the context of Neural Networks classifiers. The methods to compare include:

- [x] Vanilla Monte Carlo (MC)
- [x] Multiple Importance Splitting (MLS)
- [x] Hamiltonian-Sequential Monte Carlo (H_SMC)
- [x] Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm within Sequential Monte Carlo (MALA_SMC)
- [ ] First Order Reliability Method (FORM)
- [ ] Importance Sampling and Cross-Entropy methods (IS/CE)
- [ ] Line Sampling methods (LS)
