# stat_reliability_measure

This repository contains implementations of Sequential Monte Carlo methods to estimate the probability of failure of neural networks under noisy inputs.

## Requirements
The code was tested on python3.8+.
The main requirements are torch>=1.8, numpy, scipy, matplotlib and pandas.
All requirements can be installed/checked using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Running the experiments
All experiments in our paper can be reproduced using the experiments scripts.
